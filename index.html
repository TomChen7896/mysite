      <h2>Academic Interest</h2>
      <p>
        My research lies at the intersection of Politics and Sociology. 
        I am interested in researching how the uneven distribution of public resources reinforces persistent poverty in communities, and how the media shapes ideological divergence and eventually affecting voting turnout.
